## Supported Versions

v2.0.2 and later is completely tested with all cases and work very well. We always recommend to use the most latest version of major change.

This package versioning work like MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH structure.
- MAJOR CHANGE: If it's a major change consider reading the changes and updates before updating the version, because most of the time major change may break your current code or output is not as expected.
- MINOR CHANGE: If it's a minor change then you may find some new methods, features, or even a new captcha-generator too. :)
- PATCH CHANGE: Most of these changes comes with updated readme, reduced unpacked size, or a small bug fix.

All the versions before v2.0.2 works very well but have some very small bugs.

### Versions
#### v1
v1 is created for simple captcha creations. It is only capable of supporting simple customisation.

#### v2
v2 is released with more customisation method and a complete new background coding. It may not be wrong to say that I totally changed the code from v1.

#### v3
v3 is released and I shifted to skia-canvas, also more deeper level customisation is introduced. The whole thing is recoded in Typescript.
